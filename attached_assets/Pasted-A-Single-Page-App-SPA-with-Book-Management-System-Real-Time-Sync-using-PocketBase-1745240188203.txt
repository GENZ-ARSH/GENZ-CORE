✅ Prompt to Use (aka your "Mission Brief")

    💬 Prompt:

    "Create a modern SPA using HTML + TailwindCSS (or React if needed) that connects to PocketBase backend for real-time book management. The app should include:

        Book list view (title, author, tags, cover image)

        Admin panel with add/edit/delete functionality

        Real-time syncing (when a book is added/edited by any user, it's reflected instantly)

        Optional login system with role-based access control (admin vs user)

        File upload support for book covers using PocketBase storage

        Search & filter by tags/class

        Persistent theme (dark/light toggle) using localStorage Use PocketBase's REST API/WebSocket client for real-time updates. Ensure clean UI and modular component structure."

🧰 PocketBase Setup (before dev)

Here’s what you'll need:

    Install PocketBase

    ./pocketbase serve

    Create Collection: books

        Fields:

            title (text)

            author (text)

            tags (list of strings)

            cover (file/image)

            class (select: 9th–12th, JEE, NEET, etc.)

    (Optional) Create Auth Collection:

        For login system (Admins/Users)

📦 PocketBase JS SDK

Use PocketBase’s client:

<script src="https://unpkg.com/pocketbase/dist/pocketbase.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  const pb = new PocketBase('http://127.0.0.1:8090');
</script>

⚡ Features in Code:

When I build it, it'll include:

    📤 pb.collection('books').create({...})

    📝 pb.collection('books').update(id, {...})

    ❌ pb.collection('books').delete(id)

    📡 Real-time subscribe:

    pb.collection('books').subscribe('*', function (e) {
      console.log('Book changed:', e.record)
    })
