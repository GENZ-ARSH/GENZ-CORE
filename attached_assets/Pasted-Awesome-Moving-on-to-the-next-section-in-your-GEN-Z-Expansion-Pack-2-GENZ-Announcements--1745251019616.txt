Awesome! Moving on to the next section in your GEN-Z Expansion Pack:

✅ 2. GENZ Announcements Board

Goal:

Create an admin-only announcement panel where admins can post important updates like:

“New batch uploaded”

“Site maintenance notice”

“Top contributor of the week”


Users can only view the announcements. Admins can add/delete/edit posts.

Next:

Do you want me to now generate the full working announcements.html code with Firebase & Tailwind, just like the chat room?

Or should we move ahead to Section 3: GENZ Leaderboard prompt setup?
